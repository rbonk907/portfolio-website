                    Hello, Iâ€™m Ryan Bonk, and I have a deep passion for beautiful interactive apps on the internet. 
                    I was first introduced to web development when I began the Full-Stack Engineering course on 
                    CodeCademy back in the summer of 2021. I began viewing websites in a whole new light and quickly 
                    fell in love with the beautiful layouts that are possible with CSS and the endless possibilities 
                    for interaction with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 
                    2020 where I first learned to program, using C++. After college, I was hired by a small firm in 
                    Anchorage, Alaska, where I currently work as an Electrical Engineer. After a few months of 
                    working, I discovered there was a void in my life that needed to be filled by some form of 
                    computer programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to today and I could not be more enamored by web technologies, encouraging me to 
                    pursue a career change.
                </p>
                <p>
